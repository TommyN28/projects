# merge_sort
merge_sort is a class project I completed in April 2022. This program was designed and developed to demonstrate a binary merge sorting algorithmn and a 3-way merge
sorting algorithmn. The program will create an array of randomly generated integer values and sort them using either method. Upon starting the program, the user will be
prompted to enter an integer value for the size of the array, and an integer range for the array values to be randomly generated to. The user will then be prompted to
enter their choice for which sorting method to use, binary merge sort or 3-way merge sort. From there, the program will sort the array in **descending** order. Finally,
the sorted array and original unsorted array will be written to a text file called "sorted.txt" and "unsorted.txt" respectively.
