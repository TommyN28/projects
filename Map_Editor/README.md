# Map_Editor

This program is an in-progess development of a 2D Zelda-like game for my Programming Paradigms class. Upon running the program, a user can click at various spots within the window place and remove tiles to create a maze-like pattern for a character to be later added. They can also scroll through different "rooms" where they can place their tiles. They can also save their tile arrangements to a json file and load their arrangement from there. A pre-set map json file is provided and can be loaded after running the program. The program itself is coded in java and developed in VS Code. A build script is included for the program.
to compile and run it.
