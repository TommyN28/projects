# simple_calculator
simple_calculator is a my first personal, out-of-classroom, project. This program aims to function as a 2-variable calculator. The user will input one or two
floating-point values. From there, the program will prompt the user for which type of operation they wish to perform on the two values. The operation will be performed
and the resulting value will be outputted back the user.

This program was coded in C++ using object-oriented programming techniques. The original code was designed, developed, and compiled in the free online IDE OnlineGDB.
