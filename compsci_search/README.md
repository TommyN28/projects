# compsci_search
compsci_search is an in-class project assignment I worked on in January. compsci_search serves as a program that stores pre-set information about various famous
computer scientists into an array. The program then allows a user to search for a specific person utilizing a specified search criteria. If a match was found, the
corresponding computer scientist's information is outputted to the user.

This program was coded in C++ utilizing object-oriented programming techniques. This program was designed, developed, and compiled in the free online IDE OnlineGDB.
